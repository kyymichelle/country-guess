#### Typescript

Decided to test out Typescript with this project. Because ESLint doesn't support it out of the box, but going ahead [ESLint will be supported in favour of TSLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288#developer-productivity-tools-and-integration), I installed [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser)

[helpful for getting my head around the setup](https://medium.com/@dors718/linting-your-react-typescript-project-with-eslint-and-prettier-2423170c3d42)

For a while the project wasn't picking up my prettier configs - turns out I had named the config file `prettierrc.js` rather than `.prettierrc.js`.
