#### Overview

The aim of this project is to make a simple word guessing game utilising this [GraphQL API](https://countries.trevorblades.com/). Along the way, I'd like to familiarise myself with using Typescript with React and Redux. Here's some notes I've taken :)

#### Planning

For the guessing game, the application will first grab a list of countries from the API to populate the Redux store. Then the CountryGuessGame component can be passed random countries via its container. The CountryGuessGame component will initially be a fill-in-the-blanks string matching game, but I can later add more features to it like guess based on country flag or adjustable difficulty levels.

#### Typescript & linting

Decided to test out Typescript with this project. Because ESLint doesn't support it out of the box, but going ahead [ESLint will be supported in favour of TSLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288#developer-productivity-tools-and-integration), I installed [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser)

For a while the project wasn't picking up my prettier configs - turns out I had named the config file `prettierrc.js` rather than `.prettierrc.js`.

#### Typescript

Having done some basic setup for the project, it was time to properly learn the ins and outs of Typescript. [This handy guide](https://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html) was great for basic concepts and syntax and [this is a concise styleguide](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md). [This guide](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/how-to-use-typescript-with-react-and-redux-a118b1e02b76) goes through step by step using Typescript with React and Redux.

#### Markdown

The first thing to do was to get this blog page up and running. To do this, I followed [these examples](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42928530/how-do-i-load-a-markdown-file-into-a-react-component) in using `react-markdown`.

I had issues importing the markdown file via Typescript, as it had been giving the `Cannot find module` error. The fix was to [add a declaration file](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader/issues/56#issuecomment-423640398) so that Typescript would pick up the `.md` file extension as a module.

#### React Hooks

Initially I had started writing the CountryGuessGame component with the usual class component method. But after reading about [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) and how you didn't need to use `this` everywhere anymore, I decided to make the switch to writing a functional component. Being early in the project, the rewrite was very simple - going from:

```
export class CountryGuessGame extends React.Component<GameProps, GameState> {
  state: GameState = {
    isCorrect: false,
    numGuess: 0,
  };

  handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>): void {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(event);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <Form.Group>
          <Form.Label>Country name</Form.Label>
          <Form.Control type="text" placeholder="..." required />
        </Form.Group>
        <Button type="submit">Make your guess</Button>
      </Form>
    );
  }
}
```

To the following:

```
export const CountryGuessGame: React.FC<GameProps> = (props: GameProps) => {
  const [countryGuess, setCountryGuess] = useState('');
  const [isCorrect, setIsCorrect] = useState(false);
  const [numGuess, setNumGuess] = useState(0);

  const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>): void => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(event);
  };

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Form.Group>
        <Form.Label>Country name</Form.Label>
        <Form.Control type="text" placeholder="..." required />
      </Form.Group>
      <Button type="submit">Make your guess</Button>
    </Form>
  );
};
```

However that involved removing the GameState interface, so to make things a bit more elegant I refactored the state:

```
// Before
const [countryGuess, setCountryGuess] = useState('');
const [isCorrect, setIsCorrect] = useState(false);
const [numGuess, setNumGuess] = useState(0);

// After
const [state, setState] = useState<GameState>({
  countryGuess: '',
  isCorrect: false,
  numGuess: 0,
});
```

After a bit of tweaking, my `CountryGuessGame` component now has a form (this may later be moved into its own component) that validates a submitted string against a solution string and then displaying a `CountryGuessAlert` component with feedback.
